# Gebbrowser
Webbrowser but my name is Gerald

This will be my first prototype of a webbrowser in its entirety
I will be initially focusing on the UI element but a simple UI
* UI to date will be a left frame taking up 1/5th of the screen, and then a central frame that is idle with a searchbar
* UI is minimalistic as there's no point crowding the user
