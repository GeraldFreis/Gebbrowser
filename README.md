# Gebbrowser
Webbrowser but my name is Gerald

// Dependencies: 
tkinter, tkinter.font, os, urllib, beautiful soup, sqlite3

This will be my first prototype of a webbrowser in its entirety
I will be initially focusing on the UI element but a simple UI
* UI to date will be a left frame taking up 1/5th of the screen, and then a central frame that is idle with a searchbar
* UI is minimalistic as there's no point crowding the user

I am now onto focusing on the parsing of the document and displaying the features onto the UI
* To do this I am using urllib to retrieve the html, and then producing a html text. And beautiful soup is then utilised to parse that html into viable python functions
